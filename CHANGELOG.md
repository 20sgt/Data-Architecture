## [2026-07-12 20:48] — Silver staging models in dbt (increment 3)

**What:** Added the 8 silver staging models as dbt SQL, plus the `bronze` source
declaration, reproducing the old notebook's flatten step. Also fixed the `sk`
macro (Jinja has no `*args`; extra args arrive as `varargs`).
**Why:** dbt now owns bronze→silver. These models unnest the nested bronze
records (matters→actions→votes, meetings→agenda_items, etc.) into flat tables.
**Files:** `dbt/models/staging/_sources.yml`, `dbt/models/staging/stg_*.sql` (8),
`dbt/macros/surrogate_key.sql` (fix)
**Notes:** Unnesting uses `LATERAL VIEW (pos)explode`. `action_seq` is taken from
`posexplode` position so it matches across `stg_actions`/`stg_votes` (the gold
join key). All 8 pass `dbt compile`; still UNVALIDATED against real data — next
step is a small one-partition bronze load to diff against the old notebook
tables before the full backfill bootstrap.

## [2026-07-12 19:52] — Bronze rework: Auto Loader lands nested Delta (increment 2)

**What:** Rewrote the Auto Loader notebook so it only *ingests* — landing whole
nested records into `bronze.matters` / `bronze.meetings` — and dropped the
flattening logic (moving to dbt). Renamed `silver_autoloader_databricks.py` →
`bronze_autoloader_databricks.py`.
**Why:** Under the new design dbt owns bronze→silver→gold; Auto Loader's only
remaining job is the file-by-file incremental read that dbt can't do. Splitting
ingestion from flattening gives a clean, testable bronze layer.
**Files:** `databricks/bronze_autoloader_databricks.py` (new), removed
`databricks/silver_autoloader_databricks.py`
**Notes:** Kept the explicit schemas (typed boundary) and lineage columns
unchanged; dates still land as raw strings (dbt parses them). `SRC` now points at
`gs://cotc_raw` and must run on a CLASSIC cluster (serverless blocks GCS egress —
a limit that applies only to this step). Not runnable until the bootstrap
(increment 6). README still references the old notebook name — fix in the docs
increment.

## [2026-07-12 19:46] — Scaffold dbt project (increment 1 of dbt migration)

**What:** Added a `dbt/` project (config, connection template, macros) that will
replace the hand-run PySpark gold notebooks with SQL models. Verified with
`dbt debug` against a serverless SQL warehouse ("All checks passed").
**Why:** Course requires dbt for silver→gold, and we want the silver+gold
transforms automated on a weekly schedule inside a Databricks Job. This is the
foundation; no tables are built yet.
**Files:** `dbt/dbt_project.yml`, `dbt/macros/{generate_schema_name,surrogate_key}.sql`,
`dbt/profiles.yml.example`, `dbt/.env.example`, `dbt/requirements-dbt.txt`, `.gitignore`
**Notes:** Kept the `xxhash64` surrogate-key formula from the notebooks so dbt
output will have byte-identical keys — lets us diff-validate the migration table
by table. Hit a macOS/Python TLS snag (`self-signed certificate in chain`): cause
was Python not finding its trust list, fixed by pointing `SSL_CERT_FILE` at
`certifi`. Not a proxy/network issue — `openssl` was clean the whole time.
